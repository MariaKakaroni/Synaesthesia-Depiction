# Synaesthesia-Depiction

Manual of synaesthesia depiction application

This is a simple manual of the synaesthesia depiction application.
Let’s get started with a simple presentation of using the application.

At first let’s press the “MAIN” navigation button from the navigation bar. The navigation bar exists in the left for screens that are over 600 pixels or on top for screens with less than 600 pixels.

This button navigates as to the introductory part of the application.



Next let’s press the DESCRIPTION navigation button.

This button navigates as to a part of the application that a descriptive text of how the application works exist.



Then the “SHAPES” button is clicked.

Now we are navigated to the table that presents one by one the shapes and the curves that we can choose to add to our personal SVG canvas creation. The table has two columns. One with the name of the shape or curve that may be depicted on the canvas and one with the svg images that depict the actual shape or curve. By pressing on one of the rows that the table contains, the selected shape or curve will appear on the SVG canvas. For example let’s click on the ellipse.



Now we press the CANVAS navigation button to lead us to the SVG canvas to see what the precedent movement created. 



As we can see an ellipse is displayed on the canvas. Now we have a bunch of options to modify the ellipse and the canvas itself. 
Let’s take a lool at our options one by one it the order that are presented. 
We will at first pick a blue color, out of the “Choose color” of the “canvas options” pallette, for the background of the canvas. 



Now we can pick a different orientation for the canvas from the “Select canvas orientation” of the “canvas options” selections. We will pick the square orientation option.



Afterwards we are going to modify the last created shape that exists on the canvas, that in our case is the ellipse.
We pick a yelloish color, out of the “Draw the shape with this color” of the “Shape options” pallette, for the drawing line of the ellipse as it is shown.



Then with the help of the “Select the thickness of the drawing line” slider, we make the line a little bit thicker.



Now we decrease the opacity of the drawing line of the ellipse from the “Select the opacity of the drawing line” slider.



The color of the interior of the shape can be modified with the “Fill the shape with this color” of the “Shape options” pallette. In this case we’ve picked a red color to fill the ellipse.



Then we selected the opacity of the interior color of the ellipse with the “Select the opacity of the shape” of the “Shape options” slider. 
As we see, as the opacity of the object that is drawn on the canvas decreases, the colors of the canva’s and the object’s blend creating a new hue.



Now it’s time to define the position, rotation and size of the ellipse.
First we move the ellipse horizontally with the “Move shape horizontally” of the “Shape options” slider. 



Then we move the ellipse vertically with the “Move shape vertically” of the “Shape options” slider. 



Now we rotate the ellipse with the “Rotate the shape(in degrees)” of the “Shape options” slider. Moving the slider from the default postion(left) to the right the rotation is clockwise.



The last modification that we will make is resizing the ellipse. We increase the size of the ellipse with the “Size of the shape” of the “Shape options” slider. 



Time to visit the other buttons of the navigation bar.

Let’suppose that our canvas is ready to be saved. We press the SAVE button from the navigation bar and we note that an SVG file is downloaded on our device. 




By clicking on the downloaded file a new tab in our current using browser is opened that presents the depiction that we designed before clicking the SAVE button.




Now what if we are not pleased with the result that we see in the SVG canvas area of the application. We can erase the last drawn shape by pressing th UNDO button like that. 



After the erasion of one or more objects of the canvas, we can re-reveal the objects in the order that were erased (from the last erased to the first one). We can re-reveal the ellipse as it was drawn like this.
